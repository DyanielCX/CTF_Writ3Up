## Solution
In the description, we can see a [youtube clip link](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxrLa5UkwGkGiDT3IZoZUS6jDORSAjrCiQ?si=JKvLpTN-mHsA4snO) with a song.... 
"**IN YOUR HEADDDD~ IN YOUR HEADDD~ Zombiee Zombiee~~**" ^A^

Beside, this challenge also has provide a pcapng file. So as normal will open it with **Wireshark**

I have do some checking and analysis on this file with the built-in features in statistic tab. When come to check the *conservartion*, 
I find a suspicious situation which is the large amount of packet tranfer between `10.10.1.13` and `10.10.1.9`, with the total 82.

At that moment, I remember back the lyrics of the youtube clip song - **ZOMBIEEE**

So, I feel this might something like zombie attack or DDOS attack. After this I stuck at here.... QwQ
