**For this question, I'm using the postman to solve it**
<p>Postman Website - https://www.postman.com/</p>

1. Open the inspect of the website, go to network tab and find the website index file

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

2. Click the request headers box to change it to raw. Copy the request URL and request header to postman
   <p><b>!Attention - remember don't copy the "GET / HTTP/1.1" in first line!</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

3. Since you have get the hint **"Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!"** in the website. Change the **user agent** to PicoBrowser and send again.
   You will get the next hint **"I don't trust users visiting from another site."**

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

5. So we add a **Referer** with the request URL in the header and get the next hint **"Sorry, this site only worked in 2018."**
   <p><b>##The Referer header - allows a server to identify referring pages that people are visiting from or where requested resources are being used.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

6. Now we add a **datetime with 2018 date** in the header and get the next message which this website don't trust the tracked user.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

7. So we continue add new element to header. This time we add **DNT** to the header and it continue say **this website on only for Sweden person**
   <p><b>##DNT (Do Not Track) request header indicates the userâ€™s tracking preference. It lets users indicate whether they would prefer privacy rather than personalized content.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

8. We continue with add **X-Forwarded-For** and put the value with sweden IP address. For here we using 102.177.146.5, you can use any IP address that signed for Sweden.
Here he continue say **we are only in Sweden but we can't speak Swedish.**

<p><b>##X-Forwarded-For request header - helps to identify the IP address of a client when using an HTTP or HTTPS load balance</b></p>
